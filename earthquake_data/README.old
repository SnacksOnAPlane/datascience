	SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SEISMOGRAPHIC NETWORK (SCSN) FORMAT CATALOG DATA
	--------------------------------------------------------------------

CATALOG DATA
------------
    The earthquake catalog of the SCSN consists of data from 1932 through
the present.  It is complete for local events greater than or equal to 
M3.0 since 1932, and above M1.8 since 1981. Between the time periods of
January 1984 through the present, it is complete for all magnitude events.

   SCSN catalog data in the Caltech format (described below) is stored in 
yearly ascii *.catalog files.  Beginning with 1975, these files cover a time
period of one year.  Events from 1932 to 1959 are listed in 193259.catalog; 
1960 to 1974 events in 196074.catalog.

				Event qualities are highly suspect prior
                                to 1990.  Many of these event qualities
                                are based on incomplete information.
                                Also, they are really only applicable
                                to LOCAL events
